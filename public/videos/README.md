# Hero Video

Place the hero video file `hero-manufacturing.mp4` in this directory.

## Video Requirements:

- **Format**: MP4 (H.264 codec recommended)
- **Duration**: 10-30 seconds (loopable)
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 or higher (16:9 aspect ratio)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (critical for proper display)
- **File Size**: Under 10MB for web performance
- **Content**: Manufacturing process, apparel creation, or brand showcase

## Video Optimization for Hero Background:

### **Aspect Ratio Guidelines**

- **Standard**: 16:9 (1920x1080) works best for most screens
- **Ultra-wide**: 21:9 (2560x1080) for cinematic feel
- **Safe Zone**: Keep important content in center 80% of frame

### **Content Composition Tips**

1. **Center Important Elements**: Keep key visual elements in the center 80% of the frame
2. **Avoid Text in Video**: Let overlay text handle messaging
3. **Smooth Motion**: Avoid quick cuts or jarring movements
4. **Consistent Lighting**: Maintain even exposure throughout

### **Technical Settings**

- **Bitrate**: 5-8 Mbps for 1080p
- **Frame Rate**: 24-30fps (consistent throughout)
- **Color Profile**: Rec.709 for web compatibility
- **Audio**: Remove audio track to reduce file size

## Current Implementation:

The hero video now uses an intelligent scaling approach that:

- **Centers the video** and scales it to fill the container
- **Maintains aspect ratio** to prevent distortion
- **Minimizes cropping** while ensuring full coverage
- **Works responsively** across all device sizes

## Video Ideas:

1. **Manufacturing Process**: Wide shots of textile production
2. **Quality Control**: Close-ups of fabric inspection and testing
3. **Team Working**: People operating machinery and quality checks
4. **Product Showcase**: Smooth transitions between different apparel items
5. **Facility Tour**: Steady camera movement through clean, modern facility

## If Video Still Appears Zoomed:

1. **Check Video Aspect Ratio**: Ensure your video is exactly 16:9
2. **Reduce Video Resolution**: Try 1280x720 if 1920x1080 is too large
3. **Check Content Framing**: Ensure important details are in center of frame
4. **Test on Multiple Devices**: Verify appearance on mobile, tablet, and desktop

For now, the hero section will work without the video and show the gradient background with overlay pattern.
